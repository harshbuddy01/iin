## 🔥 EMERGENCY HOTFIX - SERVER CRASH RESOLVED

### Critical Issue:
**Backend server was DOWN** due to syntax error I introduced:
```
PathError [TypeError]: Missing parameter name at index 1: *
at backend/server.js:145 - app.options('*', cors())
```

### Fix Applied:
- ❌ REMOVED: Broken `app.options('*', cors())` line
- ✅ KEPT: Main CORS configuration (already handles OPTIONS)
- ✅ CORS is properly configured without the broken line

### Root Cause:
Express routing doesn't support '*' as a path parameter in some versions.
The CORS middleware already handles OPTIONS requests, so the explicit handler was redundant and breaking.

### What's Fixed:
1. Server will now START successfully
2. CORS is still properly configured
3. Payment verification should work

## Deployment Status:
- Commit: [576b641](https://github.com/harshbuddy01/vigyan/commit/576b641f652429fbc0e739d4799126e2ebd6d8f4)
- Status: ⏳ Deploying...
- Expected: 2-3 minutes

## Testing After Deploy:
1. Wait 3 minutes for server restart
2. Check https://backend-vigyanpreap.vigyanprep.com/health
3. Should return: `{"status": "ok"}`
4. Then test payment flow again

## My Apologies:
I introduced a breaking change in the previous fix.
This hotfix removes the problematic line while keeping
all the CORS enhancements that DO work.
