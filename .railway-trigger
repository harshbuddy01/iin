## Critical Fixes Applied:

### 1. Enhanced CORS Configuration (backend/server.js)
- ✅ Added explicit OPTIONS handler for all routes
- ✅ Enhanced CORS to allow all vigyanprep.com subdomains
- ✅ Added 'Origin' to allowed headers
- ✅ Set optionsSuccessStatus to 204
- ✅ Set preflightContinue to false

### 2. Payment Verification (Already Fixed)
- ✅ Backend already accepts 'amount' parameter in paymentController.js (line 212)
- ✅ Frontend testfirstpage.html already sends 'amount' parameter (line 786)

### Expected Results:
- ✅ CORS errors should be resolved
- ✅ Payment verification should work successfully
- ✅ Success modal should appear after payment
- ✅ Auto-redirect to tests should work
